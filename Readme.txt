This github repository contains the scripts used to create a global NO2 land use regression model.  Files are divided into three folders, 
with each folder corresponding to a unique stage of model development.

variable estimates - scripts in this folder were used to derive NO2 estiamtes at air monitor locations using parallel processing.
upwind estimates = scripts in this folder were used to estimate length of road upwind from air monitor locations.
statitical analysis - scripts in this folder were used to perform lasso variable selection, model evaluation, and sensitivity analysis.
